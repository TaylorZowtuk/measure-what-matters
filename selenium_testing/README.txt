To run Selenium testing, use '>npm install' from the root of the selenium_testing directory

Then uses '>npm run test' to run the selenium testing. A report will be generated in the ReportDirectory under the name "Mochawesome.html"

The file MWM-SeleniumTestingReport.html was the html report file generated for the run used for testing.

A PDF version is also available in the ReportDirectory, but cuts out small parts of testing, so the html file is recommended.
